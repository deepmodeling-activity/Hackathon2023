# Question background

With AI4Science booming, we see a series of software with great potential, such as **DeePMD-kit**, **ABACUS**, **DMFF**, **Uni-Mol**, **DeepFlame** wait. These softwares have achieved amazing performance in many fields, such as DeePMD-kit successfully simulating the movement of 100 million atoms, such as Uni-Mol's excellent performance in predicting the properties of MOF materials and OLED materials. However, in fact, the prospect of AI4Science is far more than that. We believe that a large number of fields in the future may be restructured by AI4Science, and a series of exciting results will definitely be produced in this process.


Therefore, in this track, we encourage all contestants to explore and extend the application of AI4Science in different scenarios. This kind of exploration can be to use more advanced algorithms to explore a certain scene, such as using AI4Science to explore your own topics; you can also customize the development of related algorithms according to the particularity of related scenes, so that the algorithm can adapt to more Application scenarios; user interfaces and workflows that are more user-friendly can also be developed based on these. Let's explore the various possibilities of AI4Science applications together, and deepen our understanding of domain knowledge in the process.


**The questions on this track are divided into two parts: free questions and fixed questions. We especially encourage everyone to do free propositions, as long as any ideas related to AI4Science are very welcome; of course, if you are at a loss for free propositions, you can also participate in the fixed proposition track and use your creativity and talent under the specified proposition.**


## 1. Free proposition

Competitors in this track have full creative freedom and can choose any AI4Science-related ideas to complete. including but not limited to:


- **Scenario exploration**: Use AI4Scienceâ€™s algorithms or software to explore some practical application scenarios

- **Workflow development category**: develop AI4Science workflow around some common scenarios (it is recommended to use dflow to build related workflows, but it is not mandatory)


Contestants who choose this track need to submit their own proposals in the preliminary stage to describe their ideas and initially confirm the feasibility of the idea (the review team will also give some constructive guidance and suggestions to facilitate better implementation).

## 2. Reference questions

- **Question 1: Uni-Mol X: Using pre-trained models to explore new applications of 3D molecular representation learning**


- **Question 2: dflow X: Develop AI4Science Cloud Native Workflow**


- **Question 3: DMFF: LJ potential parameter adjustment**


- **Question 4: DeepFlame: Solve the one-dimensional hedging diffusion flame**
