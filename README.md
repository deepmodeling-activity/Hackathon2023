- Here, you can complete your most anticipated challenges;

We provide a prize pool of ￥200,000, round-trip tickets to the stadium, and online participation;

We have prepared everything and look forward to working with you to unleash the infinite possibilities of AI4Science!

## Participation Requirements

Simply, we welcome all teachers, students and industry practitioners who are interested in AI4Science.

Specifically:

- If you are interested in the application scenarios of AI4Science, we welcome you to use the latest AI4Science tools to explore any scenarios you want to solve problems that were not easy to solve by classical methods in the past; you are also welcome to develop more AI4Science-related tools based on specific scenarios Easy-to-use user interface and workflow.

- If you are interested in AI4Science's underlying algorithm principles and related model construction, we welcome your ideas to communicate with us, improve existing softwares or build your own softwares.

- If you are interested in high-performance optimization, we welcome you to try it boldly and release the unlimited potential of software and hardware by yourself.

- If you are interested in sharing and disseminating knowledge, we welcome you to adopt innovative ways to disseminate relevant knowledge and ideas, and spread AI4Science to more people.

Finally, if you are interested in AI4Science, but you are not sure what you can do, or even whether you are capable enough, we still strongly encourage you to sign up first to discuss and learn with everyone. Interest is the best teacher, and actual combat is the fastest way to learn. Here you will definitely find a track where you can give full play to your enthusiasm and expertise, and explore the sea of stars of AI4Science together.

## Track Introduction

In this Hackathon, we encourage all ideas, explorations and practices related to AI4Science. For different themes, this Hackathon has set up **5** tracks:

**AI4Science Application Scenario Exploration (Beijing)**: This track encourages contestants to use AI4Science related software as a tool to explore the scenarios they want to explore. Contestants can use AI4Science related tools to help their research, such as using Uni-Mol to screen active molecules, using DPA-1 to explore the conformation of small molecules, using DMFF to modify the interaction between functional groups, and using DeepFlame to explore the interaction mechanism between turbulence and combustion ; You can also develop customized workflows, convenient and easy-to-use user interfaces, etc. for specified scenarios. As long as it is related to AI4Science, all application explorations are encouraged here!

**AI4Science Hardcore Software Development (Beijing)**: This track is jointly sponsored by the DeepModeling open source community, Peking University Supercomputing Team, and Peking University Linux Club. This track encourages players to actively participate in the development of AI4Science's own tools. Students who are interested in high performance can optimize the specified software for high performance; students who are interested in AI can reconfigure certain networks. Or you find that there are some other problems in the software that you want to improve - in short, as long as it is related to AI4Science, all software development is encouraged here!

**AI for Biomedicine (Shanghai)**: This track encourages contestants to use AI4Science related software tools to try to solve problems of general concern in the field of biomedicine. It is hoped that the contestants can propose solutions to the existing application scenarios in the field of biomedicine, such as various property predictions, target predictions, combination mode exploration and molecular generation and other practical scenarios; at the same time, contestants are encouraged to try to use different software and tools, such as Uni -Mol explores a certain field in depth - in short, as long as it is related to AI4Science and biomedicine, all explorations are encouraged here!

**AI for ElectroChemistry (Xiamen)**: This track is co-sponsored by the DeepModeling open source community and Kah Kee Innovation Laboratory Artificial Intelligence Applied Electrochemistry Joint Laboratory (AI4EC), aiming to encourage students who want to explore various materials related to the battery field For contestants with electrochemical properties, use AI4Science related software tools to develop workflows for the calculation of properties such as material redox potential and reaction free energy change in a certain system or in a certain environment; it can also be used to solve a certain Specific problems, in short, if you are eager to use materials to continuously define energy, you are welcome to join the exploration journey of AI for Electrochemistry.

**AI4Science Evangelism (Beijing)**: This track encourages contestants to spread AI4Science related knowledge and ideas to others in innovative ways. The content of the explanation can be a cutting-edge paper of AI4Science, its own scientific research results, or interesting popular science knowledge; the form can consider course videos, Bohrium Notebook cases, wikipedia or more flexible short videos, Xiaohongshu, etc.—— In short, as long as the spread of ideas related to AI4Science is encouraged here!

The above is the overall track classification of Hackathon. All ideas related to AI4Science are welcome.

## Competition System Introduction
